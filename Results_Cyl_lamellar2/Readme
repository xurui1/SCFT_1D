Fully converged solution (accuracy 1e-4), for the spherical coordinates. Free energy difference almost exactly -1. Looks promising. Fixed double counting for interaction free energy. Still having some trouble with i=0 point, sometimes phiA,B wonâ€™t budge. Perhaps modify random variable component of initial omega field.
